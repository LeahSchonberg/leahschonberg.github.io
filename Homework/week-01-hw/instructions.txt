//// Homework #1 - Due 11/03/2015 ////
//////////////////////////////////////

//// GOALS ///

This assignment will help reinforce the following topics from week 1:
- HTML structure
- HTML elements
- <img> and <a> tags
- CSS styles
- Using <link> tags to connect HTML and CSS files


//// SETUP ////

1) Ensure you have created a folder titled `homework` inside of the `.github.io` folder that is ON YOUR COMPUTER
2) Copy the `week—01-hw` folder into `homework` folder

//// INSTRUCTIONS ////

1) Add proper HTML structure to: index.html and about.html

Ensure you included your Doctype, html, head, and body tags!

2) After you build proper HTML structure, go wild and populate both pages (index and about) with HTML elements as you see fit.

- Treat index.html as a "home-page" of sorts. Include some information about yourself.
- Treat resume.html as a resume - list your current/previous roles, education, special skills, etc.

Here are some tags we went over in class:

- <h1>, <h2>
- <p>
- <ul> or <ol>
- <li>

Pleas feel free to include more!

3) Use <a> tags on each page that link to the other. In other words, use an anchor tag on index.html that links to resume.html, and vice-versa.

4) Use a <link> tag to attach the style.css file to each of the .html files. Remember, this tag should be placed within the <head> element.

5) Add CSS styles to your page!

6) Add at least one image to this folder (week—01-hw), and use the <img> tag to include the image in either/both of your .html pages.


/// WRAP UP ///

1) When you complete the assignment, see if you can complete the `week-01-hw-bonus` assignment
2) Setup the bonus assignment the same way you did the assignment above: copy the `week-01-hw-bonus` file to the `homework1 folder in your `.github.io` folder
3) When you are ready to submit your homework: 

- Open the GitHub desktop application
- Click on your `.github.io` folder in the left-hand menu (this might already be selected)
- Make sure you are looking at the changes you have made (there is a toggle at the top of the application)
- When viewing the changes you have made, ensure they are all checked
- Make a commit (remember, you have to have a summary message)
- Sync/Publish (button in the top-right corner)
- Go to your GitHub.com account and check to see if the changes have been made!
