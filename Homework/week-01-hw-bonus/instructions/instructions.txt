Homework #1 (Optional Bonus Challenge) - Due 11/03/2015

1) The goal of the bonus assignment is to replicate the two specs you see in the instructions/ folder:

- about.png
- portfolio.png

2) The folder class-02-hw-bonus/ contains everything you need to get started:

- index.html (you would re-create about.png here)
- portfolio.html (you would re-create portfolio.png here)
- style.css (link this file to both index and portfolio)
- three images: citipix, relaxr, and startup_matchmaker (you would include these images in portfolio.html

Hints/Tips:

Start with about.html first:

1) Add proper HTML structure (doctype, head, etc.)
2) Use a <link> tag to connect it with style.css
3) Add the HTML first; in other words, build the content and then add the CSS styling
